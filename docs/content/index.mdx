# Kurt's Homelab

This project utilizes [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) to automate provisioning, operating, and updating self-hosted services in my [homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction/). It can be used as a highly customizable framework to build your own homelab.

> [!TIP]

> A home lab is a personal setup of servers and networking equipment at home for learning, experimenting, and self-hosting services. It often uses repurposed enterprise hardware or small devices like Raspberry Pis to run virtualization, containers, and applications. It's a sandbox for developing skills and hosting services without cloud costs.
