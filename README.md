## Hardware

I'll make a pretty diagram and or include some photos at some point

### Rack

 - 1x [StarTech.com 18U 19in Open Frame Server Rack](https://www.startech.com/en-ca/server-management/4postrack18u)

### Power Management

 - 1x [Square D Home Electronics Protective Device 80 kA](https://www.se.com/ca/en/product/HEPD80C/spd%2C-hepd-type-1%2C-120-240-v%2C-1-ph%2C-3-wire%2C-80-ka%2C-consumer-packaging/?range=61969-square-d-hepd-home-electronics-protective-device&node=12368269215-hepd&selected-node-id=12368269215)
 - 2x [Leviton 20 Amp Hospital Grade Surge Outlet](https://www.leviton.com/en/products/t8380-w)
   - Each outlet has a dedicated 20A breaker, this was done for a future deployment of multiple UPS each would get their own outlet / breaker

   - Version 1 of the power managment in the rack, UPS coming soon
 - 1x [StarTech.com 1U 19in Metal Rackmount Cable Management Panel](https://www.startech.com/en-ca/server-management/cablmanager2)
   - This is used to tidy up the power cables coming to the bottom of the rack into the APC AP7801 PDU

### Networking

We've recently upgraded from 1000 Mbps cable internet to 8 Gbps fiber. We're slowing upgrading our networking hardware to 10GbE to get the most out of it.

## Kubernetes

I'm using [k3s](https://k3s.io) as my Kubernetes flavour. It was super easy to get up and running and is much less resource heavy then other options. I had previously tried to use [microk8s](https://microk8s.io) and ended up with a unrecoverable cluster failure.

### Setting up K3s

```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - server \
  --cluster-init \
  --cluster-cidr 10.34.0.0/16 \
  --service-cidr 10.35.0.0/16 \
  --cluster-dns 10.35.5.5 \
  --write-kubeconfig-mode 644 \
  --bind-address 0.0.0.0 \
  --advertise-address 10.33.0.1 \
  --disable traefik \
  --disable servicelb \
  --disable local-storage \
  --flannel-backend=host-gw
```

## Networking

### Layout

| CIDR          | Description                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| `10.33.0.0/12` | UniFi VLAN                 |
| `10.34.0.0/16` | K3s Pods                   |
| `10.35.0.0/16` | K3s Services               |
| `10.36.0.0/16` | MetalLB External Addresses |

## Deployment Order

```
just deploy system/metal-lb
just deploy system/twingate
just deploy system/traefik
just deploy system/cert-manager
just deploy system/longhorn
```
